        2024 is over, 2025 is here. Here is what I was doing this year represented through
        yearly heatmaps.

          Damn I fell off. Although I feel like I've still been gaining muscle more now.
          I started my first job near the end of April. You can see how the frequency
          decreases after this point.

        <p>
          I feel my reading habit comes and goes in waves. Although from september onward
          I've been locked in. That's when I started daily driving the Hisense A9 as my
          phone. It has an e-ink screen so it meant I didn't have to go find my kindle 
          to read.

          2024 was the year I learned how to code (properly). I learned react, spring boot,
          typescript, vite, rest apis, graphql queries and so much moree. Although having
          done all that I was not able to land a single web dev job offer ðŸ’€.
