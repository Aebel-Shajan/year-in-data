## Frontend

* I used [cal-heatmap](https://cal-heatmap.com/) to visualise the data as heatmaps.

## Backend
* Gather data -> pandas dataframe -> apply transformations -> store in sqlite db.
* I was gonna fastapi and deploy it on render.com but I fail.
* Instead I converted the sqlite db into jsons and uploaded them on a seperate branch.
